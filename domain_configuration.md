# Domain Configuration for www.fntx.ai

This document outlines the steps needed to configure the domain www.fntx.ai to point to your new application.

## Current Hosting

The demonstration website is currently hosted at: https://bjyeorny.manus.space

This is a temporary hosting solution provided by Manus's static site hosting service.

## Domain Configuration Steps

To change the domain to www.fntx.ai, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. **DNS Configuration**:
   - Log in to your domain registrar where fntx.ai is registered
   - Access the DNS settings for the domain
   - Add a CNAME record:
     - Name: `www`
     - Value: `bjyeorny.manus.space` (or your production server's domain)
     - TTL: 3600 (or as recommended by your registrar)

2. **SSL Certificate**:
   - Ensure your hosting provider supports SSL for custom domains
   - Request an SSL certificate for www.fntx.ai
   - Some hosting providers offer automatic SSL with Let's Encrypt

3. **Web Server Configuration**:
   - Configure your web server to respond to requests for www.fntx.ai
   - Set up proper HTTP to HTTPS redirects
   - Ensure the server is configured to use the correct SSL certificate

4. **Application Configuration**:
   - Update any hardcoded URLs in your application to use www.fntx.ai
   - Configure CORS settings to allow requests from www.fntx.ai

## Production Hosting Options

For a production environment, you have several options:

1. **Cloud Providers**:
   - AWS (Amazon Web Services)
   - Google Cloud Platform
   - Microsoft Azure
   - Digital Ocean

2. **Specialized Hosting**:
   - Heroku for the backend
   - Netlify or Vercel for the frontend
   - Firebase for both frontend and backend

3. **Self-Hosted**:
   - Virtual Private Server (VPS)
   - Dedicated server

## Recommended Setup

For a production-ready fntx.ai application with real-time data requirements:

1. **Frontend**:
   - Host on Netlify or Vercel for global CDN and easy deployment
   - Configure custom domain in the hosting dashboard
   - Set up automatic deployments from your GitHub repository

2. **Backend**:
   - Host on AWS using Elastic Beanstalk or ECS for scalability
   - Use RDS for database storage
   - Configure WebSocket support through API Gateway
   - Set up auto-scaling for handling traffic spikes

3. **Domain**:
   - Configure www.fntx.ai to point to your frontend hosting
   - Use api.fntx.ai for your backend API
   - Ensure both subdomains have proper SSL certificates

## Testing Domain Configuration

After configuring your domain, test it using:

```bash
dig www.fntx.ai
curl -I https://www.fntx.ai
```

Verify that:
- DNS resolves correctly
- HTTPS works properly
- The application loads as expected
